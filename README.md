## Details

This demo displays real-time market data for 20 stocks, generated by the feed simulator included in the [Stock-List Demo Java Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java). For simplicity, only the "stock_name" and "last_price" fields of updated items are displayed, and they are just logged to the console. Moreover, a single JMS topic is used for all stocks, while in a real scenario you would probably use a different JMS topic for each stock.

Check out the sources for further explanations.

## Install

If you want to install a version of this demo pointing to your local Lightstreamer JMS Extender, follow these steps.

* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer JMS Extender - Stock-List Demo - Java (JMS) Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer JMS Extender instance.

## Configure

Now, you need to configure `src/client.js` of this example by specifying the name of the JMS connector you are going to use. By default, the demo will look for the **ActiveMQ** JMS connector, please refer to the related [Service project](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java) for more details on the choice of a JMS broker to be used.
To set the JMS connector name, look where the connection is created:

```js
  jms.TopicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection("http://localhost:8080/", "ActiveMQ", null, null, {
```

## Launch
From the `src` folder, run:

```sh
$ node client.js
```
