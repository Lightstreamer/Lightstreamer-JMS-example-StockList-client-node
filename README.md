## Details

This demo displays real-time market data for 30 stocks, generated by the feed simulator included in the [Stock-List Demo Java Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java). For simplicity, only the `stock_name` and `last_price` fields of updated items are displayed, and they are just logged to the console. Moreover, a single JMS topic is used for all stocks, while in a real scenario you would probably use a different JMS topic for each stock.

Check out the sources for further explanations.
